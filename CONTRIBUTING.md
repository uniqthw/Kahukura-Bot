We welcome pull requests to address any of our unassigned open issues or feature requests!

1. Only English (New Zealand) and te reo MƒÅori may be used within the project's code.
2. Ensure that you run `pnpm run pretty` to prettify your code to ensure that it remains consistent with our code styling rules. This also improves readability
3. Commenting on the code that you implement is crucial. Be in the mindset of helping someone who has never been involved with this project before seeing the code and wanting to know its purpose and what it does.
